# Automated testing

JavMetaLite uses three sequential, offline-capable test layers. The automated release gate never reads or modifies the user's media library and never depends on a live scraper website.

## Run the complete gate

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-Automated.ps1
```

Use a specific SDK executable when `dotnet` is not on `PATH`:

```powershell
.\scripts\Test-Automated.ps1 -DotNet "C:\path\to\dotnet.exe" -NoRestore
```

The projects run sequentially because the smoke and UI projects share build outputs from `JavMetaLite.Core`.

## Test layers

| Layer | Project | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core smoke | `JavMetaLite.SmokeTests` | Parsers, metadata merge, v0.5 multi-source orchestration/provenance, unified poster/fanart source selection, NFO, image conversion, basic organization and logs |
| v0.4 regression | `JavMetaLite.RegressionTests` | File layout matrix, overwrite policy, conflicts, rollback and input validation |
| UI smoke | `JavMetaLite.UiSmokeTests` | WPF window construction, dark source selector, v0.5 mixed-source badges, field and unified artwork candidate menus, top-right cover-source placement, per-field switching/manual return, safe defaults and preview window |

The regression runner supports discovery and category filters:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\JavMetaLite.RegressionTests -- --list
dotnet run --project .\JavMetaLite.RegressionTests -- --category rollback
```

Available categories are `layout`, `overwrite`, `conflict`, `rollback`, and `validation`.

## Isolation rules

- Every filesystem regression receives a unique directory below `%TEMP%`.
- Test movies contain only synthetic bytes; real media files are never used.
- HTTP image responses are local in-memory fixtures; the automated gate performs no website requests.
- Multi-source orchestration uses fake providers to cover two-source success, partial and total failure, ID mismatch, per-source call counts, and diagnostics without live requests.
- Each test verifies and removes temporary transaction artifacts.
- A failed test returns a non-zero process exit code and prevents the gate from continuing.
- A fixed defect should receive a regression case before the fix is considered complete.

## Manual checks kept outside the gate

The following remain manual because they depend on external state or human visual judgment:

- Live LibreDMM, R18.dev and JAVLibrary availability or browser verification.
- Jellyfin library scanning and presentation.
- Visual quality of poster, fanart and sample images.
- Real Windows permission prompts, antivirus interference, forced process termination and power loss.
- Final inspection of a packaged single-file executable.

These checks complement the automated gate; they are not replaced by it.
